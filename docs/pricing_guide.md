# Pricing Guide

## Baseline

**Minimum day rate:** £300/day

**Reality check:** AI assistance speeds up *building*, but client communication, revisions, and training often take longer than the code itself.

---

## Engagement Types

### 1. BUILD (I manage everything)

Client says: *"Do it for me"*

**What they get:**
- Custom site I build and host
- I make all updates on request
- They contact me for changes

**My effort:**
- Amplify + AI = fast builds
- Minimal client handholding
- Ongoing maintenance relationship

---

### 2. CONFIGURE (Platform setup)

Client says: *"Teach me basics"* + wants a platform (Shopify, WordPress, etc.)

**What they get:**
- Platform account in their name
- Fully configured and branded
- Training session(s)
- Documentation/cheat sheet

**My effort:**
- Platform setup and customisation
- Theme/template configuration
- Training time (often 2-4 hours)
- Support questions after handover

---

### 3. TRAIN (Guided DIY)

Client says: *"Guide me through it"*

**What they get:**
- Their own Hostinger/platform account
- I walk them through setup
- Multiple support sessions
- Ongoing availability for questions

**My effort:**
- Highest time investment
- Teaching non-technical people
- Patience, repetition, documentation
- Potential for scope creep

## Competitor Comparison

| Provider | Simple Site | Dynamic Site | E-commerce |
|----------|-------------|--------------|------------|
| **Me** | £400-700 | £800-1,400 | £1,500-2,500 |
| Fiverr (cheap) | £100-300 | £300-800 | £500-1,500 |
| Fiverr (quality) | £500-1,000 | £1,000-2,000 | £2,000-5,000 |
| Local agency | £2,000-5,000 | £5,000-15,000 | £10,000-30,000 |
| Squarespace DIY | £150/year | £200/year | £300/year |

**My positioning:** Better than cheap Fiverr, faster than agencies, more personal than DIY platforms.

---

## Negotiation Notes

**Hold firm on:**
- Day rate (£300 minimum)
- Scope creep (document everything)
- Payment terms (50% upfront)

**Flexible on:**
- Payment plans for larger projects
- Bundling maintenance with build
- Referral discounts

**Red flags:**
- "Can you just..." (scope creep incoming)
- "My nephew could do it for..." (price shoppers)
- "We'll have more work later..." (maybe, maybe not)
- No budget discussion (they expect free)

---

## Payment Terms

- **Under £500:** 100% upfront
- **£500-1,500:** 50% upfront, 50% on completion
- **Over £1,500:** 40% upfront, 40% at milestone, 20% on completion

**Late payment:** 5% weekly on overdue invoices (state in contract)
